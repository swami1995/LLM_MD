Trust Market : Reputation Market for AI agents for market based scalable oversight

Trust markets are a reputation system for AI agents designed to handle the dynamism and scale of an Agentic Platform. It's designed as a mechanism to incentivize and incorporate diverse forms of feedback/information from a variety of different information sources such as users, auditors, red teamers, experts, regulators etc. The repository simulates a trust market in a customer care scenario with all entities modelled as AI agents. 

(The project is still in development. Hopefully to be submitted to ICLR 2026)
